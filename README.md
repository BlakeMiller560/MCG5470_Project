This directory is for the term project for MCG 5470 Machine Learning Control Systems at the University of Ottawa. This project was created by Blake Miller and Amit Nayak. The objective of this project was to control a double inverted pendulum with 3 different algorithms:
1) Q-Learning
2) REINFORCE
3) Proximal policy optimization

The double inverted pendulum model chosen was the OpenAI Gymnasium Mujoco Double inverted pendulum [1]\
The code for Q-learning was built off [2]\
The code for REINFORCE was built off [3]\
The code for Proximal policy optimization was built off [4][5]
